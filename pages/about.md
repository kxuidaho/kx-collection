## About the Collection

This practice collection was created for practice. With practice, one can learn more about CollectionBuilder and how to use it. This particular practice collection contains photos of mines and miners from the Watkins Collection. The pictures of mostly of inside these mines, located in Idaho, Montana, or elsewhere in the United States. Carleton E. Watkins was a photographer, best-known for his large-plate photographs of the West. The photographs in this collection were thought to have been long lost, but were miraculously discovered after the 1906 San Francisco Earthquake. It is quite incredible that these photos exist to this day.
